## TASK 2: (Choose 2 out of 3)

Exercise 1:

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

Exercise 2:
In the classic problem of Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e, each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constrains:
1.       Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.       A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
3.       A disk cannot be placed on top of smaller disk.

Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks.

Exercise 3:
Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.

Example:
Input: find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}

Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)

###Solutions

The solution of each task is in its corresponding folder. Folders contain a readme file with exercise explanations. I chose to solve the first task. The task can be solved by using different techniques. I chose to use a geometric analysis, as well as a Montecarlo approximation. I decided to solve the problem by using Montecarlo because this technique could be easily expanded to many other applications and geometries.
