  "description": "Create a small application that allows a user to enter the dimensions and coordinates of two cubic objects in a 3-dimensional space. The two cubes are parallel to each other (they are not rotated in any way). Once the information has been entered, the application should calculate if the two cubes intersect, and if so, what the volume of the shared space is. Note: the coordinates specify the CENTER of the cube!",
